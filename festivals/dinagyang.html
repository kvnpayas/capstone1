					<p><span>Dinagyang Festival</span> is a showcase of the rich heritage, colorful history, passionate devotion, and fun-loving spirit of the Ilonggo people. The festival traces its roots as a thanksgiving celebration in honor of Senyor Santo Niño, the child Jesus. Today, it has grown to be one of the Philippines’ most spectacular religious and cultural festivals.</p>
					<p>The festival highlights are scheduled on the fourth weekend of January in addition to many exciting activities happening all throughout the month. The religious highlights include the fluvial procession along the Iloilo River and the Dinagyang Ati cultural parade and competition.</p>
					<p>Outside the stages, everyone can enjoy the colorful costumes, thundering drum beats, and energetic dances of the performers. The tribes perform streetdance routines along the entire parade route. Vehicles are prohibited to enter the parade route and nearby streets.
