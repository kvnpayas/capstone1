					<p><span>Pahiyas Festival</span> is an ancient celebration dating back to the 16th century. Legends have it that San Isidro Labrador magically plowed the field every time he went out of the church. This story was passed on by the Spaniards to the Filipinos during the colonial period. The word “pahiyas” means “precious offering” as connoted by the root word “hiyas” which means “jewel”. Since then, the people of Lucban and nearby towns and provinces excitedly await the summer month of May when Pahiyas Festival is held.</p>
					<p>Every year, May 15th is marked in the calendar as a day of merriment in Quezon. The streets of historic Lucban come to life and vibrant colors as people adorn their houses with local agricultural harvests – fruits, vegetables, rice grains, rice stalks, flowers and ferns. Additionally, colorful rice wafers locally called “kiping” are arranged in two or three layers of chandeliers. Kiping is made from rice dough and the local residents use different kinds of leaves to add flavor and color to the thin wafers.</p>
					<p>The festival’s highlight is a procession on the streets of Lucban where the image of San Isidro Labrador is carried by devotees as people eagerly await the passing of the image. The procession features a pair of giant paper mache figures of a farmer and his wife, which lead the procession, and  followed by the images of San Isidro Labrador and Sta. Maria de la Cabeza, who carries a basket with “triangulo biscuits”, distributed to the children during the procession. The celebration’s culminating event is a grand food sharing among the residents and the guests.</p>

					<h4>HOW TO GET TO LUCBAN, QUEZON</h4>
					<p>Lucban is a second-class municipality in Quezon bordering Tayabas to the south, Sampaloc to the north, and the province of Laguna to the east. It is in close proximity to a number of cities where transportation options are plenty including Lucena and Tayabas in Quezon, and Calamba and Sta. Cruz in Laguna.</p>
					<h5>By Public Transportation.</h5>
					<p>There are a number of options to reach Lucban from Manila. There are vans, buses or jeeps in most of the nearby cities, but this is the route that I have tried: via Lucena City.</p>
					<p>1. From Cubao, EDSA-Kamuning, or EDSA-Buendia, take a bus to Lucena City (Fare: P225, Travel time: 4-5 hours).</p>
					<p>2. At the Lucena Grand Terminal, ride a jeepney to Lucban (Fare: P30, Travel time: 30-45 minutes).</p>
					<h5>By Private Car</h5>
					<p>1. Take the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).</p>
					<p>2. Take Calamba or Sto. Tomas exit. If you exit in Calamba, you’ll be passing through numerous towns in Laguna (Los Banos, Bay, Pila, Sta. Cruz, Pagsanjan, Cavinti, Luisiana) until you reach Lucban. Travel time: 2.5-3 hours.</p>
					<p>If you take Sto. Tomas, you’ll be passing through Alaminos and San Pablo in Laguna, and Tiaong, Candelaria, and Sariaya in Quezon. When you reach Tayabas, follow the Tayabas-Lucban Road. Travel time: 3.5-4 hours.</p>
